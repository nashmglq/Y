Content-Type: You don't need to manually set Content-Type when using FormData. 
It will automatically handle the correct content type, which is typically multipart/form-data, because it includes file data.

e.target.files[0]: When you select a file using an input, e.target.files returns an array of files (even if there's only one).
By using [0], you get the first file from that array.

new FormData(): This creates a new FormData object, which allows you to append multiple key-value pairs, including files. 
Since files are objects with multiple properties (like name, size, type), you cannot directly destructure them like simple values (e.g., username, bio). 
So you need to append them one by one to the FormData object.

my own understanding:

contetn-tpye = not needed anymore, formdata will set that

e.target.files = will provide a set of array, however we want the first one which is the FILE [0]
so e.target.files will return an array of the files we uplaod [ file1 , file2]
If you want to upload only the first file from the selected files (especially when the user selects multiple files), you access it like this:
const file = e.target.files[0];


new FormData = create a new object to append new key and value, we use this becuase we have the FILE which contains a lot of values, 
we cannot destructure that using {} becuase this only destructure single values like username and bio, 
so we appen all in new object which can take a lot like the file
