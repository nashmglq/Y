CREATE TABLE profiles (
  user_id INT PRIMARY KEY,                    -- Use user_id as the primary key for profiles
  profile_image VARCHAR(255),                 -- Store image file path or URL
  bio TEXT,
  FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES authentication(id) -- Link to authentication table
);


FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES authentication(id) // always use this to get id from other or any other type
so this meanse
get the column from other id and use it as reference for the user_id so it would be the same

so it would be like
your id is user_id
however get the user_id base on the authenticationd id

so text = unli length
varchar = max length

! = if ! = true or false


so use ternary when returning something

|| for a fallback

and && if true

if  = updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP == this will add time before updated_at
if = updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NULL ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP == only add time when update


FOR CORRELATIONAL FOREIGN KEY

CREATE TABLE likedid (
    like_id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    tweet_id INT NOT NULL,
    user_id INT NOT NULL,
    FOREIGN KEY (tweet_id) REFERENCES tweets(tweet_id) ON DELETE CASCADE
);

ALTER TABLE table_name ADD created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP;
    // ORDER BY tweets.date_published DESC (descending order) = to descend order & ASC = ascend order?

CASE 
  WHEN condition THEN true_value 
  ELSE false_value 
END









CASE 
          WHEN EXISTS (
            SELECT 1 
            FROM likedid 
            WHERE likedid.userId = ? AND likedid.tweet_id = tweets.tweet_id
          ) THEN 1 
          ELSE 0 
        END AS isLiked



okay i get case, case is like if else, when is like saying when exist (check) if exist return 1 ELSE 0 END AS isLiked (this is the return from the query)

Select 1 means row found or 1 is like a placeholder that just means "yes, something was found."


so this is the flow

If (when exists) true (SELEC 1 if found something from likedid ) THEN 1
ELSE 0
END AS isLIked is what we call
